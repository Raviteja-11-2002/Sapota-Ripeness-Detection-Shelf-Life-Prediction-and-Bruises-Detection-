# Sapota-Ripeness-Detection-Shelf-Life-Prediction-and-Bruises-Detection-
The freshness and flavour of sapota, a tropical fruit, vary significantly over time, affecting both its shelf life and attraction to consumers.In addition to bruise categorization, this study investigates the use of thermal imaging for sapota ripeness detection and shelf-life prediction. The dataset consists of photos that have been classified as either rotting or not, together with the number of days that have passed since the photo was taken. Furthermore, labels indicating whether the fruit has bruises or not are included in another dataset. Various convolutional neural network (CNN) designs, such as ResNet, VGG16, and MobileNet, are employed for these tasks.The effectiveness of each model is evaluated in terms of sapota bruise detection, shelflife prediction, and ripeness classification. The findings show the possibility of thermal imaging in combination with deep learning techniques for non-destructive quality evaluation of sapota fruit, which may aid in decreasing food waste and raising customer satisfaction.
